It is not just a problem among the affluent; most middle-class households are now affected. Obesity among children increases their chances of developing type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, and certain cancers. In fact, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), over 15.5% of Indian children are obese or overweight. The World Health Organization defines child obesity as a body mass index (BMI) equal to or greater than the 85th percentile for age and sex. There are many causes of childhood obesity that range from genetics to environment.

          "content": "Genetics is one of the strongest factors associated with obesity. In fact, it is estimated that 68% of obesity is caused by genetics. Obesity can also be caused by an under-developed 'hunger’s brake' system in the brain. Add to this, certain medications such as antidepressants, painkillers, seizure medicines, anti-psychotics, and anti-anxiety medications. Another cause of childhood obesity is lipodystrophy, a condition that causes a person’s fat tissue to be severely under-developed."

          "subTitle": "Behavior and Eating Habits",
          "content": "Another cause of childhood obesity is your child’s behavior. It is important to keep in mind that obesity is not just about eating the wrong food. It is also about the environment of eating, e.g., setting the expectation that food should be eaten, and the motivation behind eating. Children are influenced by their peers; if your child sees other children eating junk food, they may also start eating junk food. Many children start eating unhealthy foods like junk food because they are bored or have little to do."
